# SnapSearch

SnapSearch is a tool for Image Question Answering using OCR Extraction and Text-to-Text generation model. It deploys a Flask web app on Vercel for seamless interaction. The basic workflow includes uploading images to the cloud, extracting text using the Tesseract OCR API from Hugging Face Space, using the extracted text to predict output text as an answer using Hugging Face's serverless API, and displaying the result.
